### EcologicalNetworksPlots

This package provides plotting abilities for `EcologicalNetworks.jl`. It uses
`RecipesBase.jl` to do the plotting through `Plots.jl`. The package currently
generates force-directed layouts, circular layouts, bipartite layouts,
heatmaps, as well as layouts based on node properties. Note that `Plots.jl`
*must* be installed in the project, and loaded, for this package to work.
