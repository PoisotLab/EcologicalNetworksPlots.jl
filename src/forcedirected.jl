Return the force for two objects at a distance d with a movemement coefficient c

repulsion, and the different families of FD layouts are determined by the values

    ForceDirectedLayout

The fields are, in order:

- `move`, a tuple to specify whether moves on the x and y axes are allowed
- `k`, a tuple (k‚Çê,k·µ£) giving the strength of attraction and repulsion
- `exponents`, a tuple (a,b,c,d) giving the exponents for the attraction and
  repulsion functions
- `gravity`, the strength of attraction towards the center, set to `0.0` as a
  default
- `Œ¥`, a floating point constant regulating the attractive force of interaction
  strength -- when set to its default value of 0.0, all edges have the same
  attraction
- `degree`, a boolean to specificy whether the nodes repel one another according
  to their degree

The various coefficients are used to decide how strongly nodes will *attract* or
*repel* one another, as a function of their distance Œî. Specifically, the
default is that connected nodes will attract one another proportionally to
(Œî·µÉ)√ó(k‚Çê·µá), with a=2 and b=-1, and all nodes repel one another proportionally to
(Œî·∂ú)√ó(k·µ£·µà) with c=-1 and d=2.

The parameterization for the Fruchterman-Rheingold layout is the default one,
particularly if k‚Çê=k·µ£. The Force Atlas 2 parameters are k‚Çê=1 (or b=0), k·µ£ set to
any value, a=1, c=-1, d=1. Note that in all cases, the gravity is a multiplying
constant of the resulting attraction force, so it will also be sensitive to
these choices. The `FruchtermanRheingold` and `ForceAtlas2` functions will
return a `ForceDirectedLayout` -- as this object is mutable, you can replace the
exponents at any time.

The Œ¥ parameter is particularly important for probabilistic networks, as these
tend to have *all* their interactions set to non-zero values. As such, setting a
value of Œ¥=1 means that the interactions only attract as much as they are
probable.

One iteration of the force-directed layout routine. Because these algorithms can
take some time to converge, it may be useful to stop every 500 iterations to
have a look at the results. Note that to avoid oscillations, the maximum
displacement at any given time is set to 0.01 units.

These layouts tend to have O(N¬≥) complexity, where N is the number of nodes in
the network. This is because repulsion required to do (N√ó(N-1))/2 visits on
pairs of nodes, and an optimal layout usually requires s√óN steps to converge.
With the maximal displacement set to 0.01, we have found that k ‚âà 100 gives
acceptable results. This will depend on the complexity of the network, and its
connectance, as well as the degree and edge strengths distributions.
